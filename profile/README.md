# [Swapin.co](https://Swapin.co/dex) Documentation

Swapin.co are a simple but proven Automated Market Maker DEX, using the secure Uniswap V2 Contracts.

Our frontend currently don't support tokens with a transaction fee, like reflect tokens.

When you add liquidity, you have to fill in max amount you wish to deploy in both tokens. Final calculation will be shown in the red box. 

Unregistered tokens can be used by pasting contract address in the Selectors. 
If you want your token to show with name in the tokenlist, please [fill the form](https://forms.gle/qFdcJTx13Qt13LHJA). For a token be listed it must have a minimum of activity!

You can view our [contracts here](https://github.com/swapinco/contracts).
